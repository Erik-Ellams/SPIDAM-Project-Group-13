5) The RT60 MID Plot button pulls up the RT60 medium frequency graph for your selected file. 
6) The RT60 HIGH Plot button pulls up the RT60 high frequency graph for your selected file. 
7) The Combined RT60 Plot button combines all the graphs and displays that graph. 
8) The Reduce Reverb to 0.5s button pulls up a amplitude (dB) over time (centiseconds).
